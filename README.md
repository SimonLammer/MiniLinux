# [Visit the MiniLinux Website](https://simonlammer.github.io/MiniLinux/)

## [Upcoming features](https://trello.com/b/04e45Mvs/minilinux)

## How it works
MiniLinux is the combined usage of several powerful tools:
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
* [Ubuntu minimal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) (Other linux distros probably work just as fine)
