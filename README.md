# MiniLinux
Minimal Linux OS to use Linux console applications on a Windows system

## How it works
MiniLinux is the combined usage of several powerful tools:
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
* [Ubuntu minimal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) (Other linux distros probably work just as fine)

## How do I set it up
