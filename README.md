# MiniLinux
Use Linux console applications on a Windows computer

# [Visit the MiniLinux Website for better depiction](https://simonlammer.github.io/MiniLinux/)
Github.com with it's markup support is nice and all, but [the github.io MiniLinux website](https://simonlammer.github.io/MiniLinux/) is much nicer.

## How it works
MiniLinux is the combined usage of several powerful tools:
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
* [Ubuntu minimal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) (Other linux distros probably work just as fine)

## How do I set it up
Check out the [setup guide](setup.md)
