# MiniLinux setup guide

## Install necessary programs
To make MiniLinux work, these programs are important:

### [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
VirtualBox will emulate a computer (=virtual machine) running a linux operating system, that will run the beloved linux based console applications.

### [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
Cmder is a console emulator for windows.
It provides a neat looking console that is in many ways (shortcuts, ...) superior to the default windows command-line (cmd).
It comes in two flavours of which i preffer the full version that comes with built in tools like git, ssh and many more.

### ssh
The full version of cmder comes with ssh, therefore have not felt the need to install it seperately.

## Create virtual machine
To use as little system resources as possible, I chose to install the [minimal version of Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) on the VM.
